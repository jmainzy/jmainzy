- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmainzy, I'm a member of the **Muscogee (Creek) Nation** and a professional software developer
- 👀 I’m interested in language preservation and revitalization, **cross-platform mobile development (Flutter!)**, and great mobile apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my React Native and React skills to broaden my horizons, though my heart truly lies with **Kotlin and Flutter**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cross-platform mobile tools, especially if they're related to minority languages
- 📫 Send me a shoutout at julia@muscogeelanguage.org
